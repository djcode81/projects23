I completed guided projects inorder to help me familiarise myself with commonly used data science tools such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc.,

All the projects in this repo are completed with the help of resouces such as DataCamp, Biomed Central and Youtube.

By actively working on these projects, I was able to gain practical experience and apply the concepts I learned from tutorials.
